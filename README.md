# Overview
A VBA script that combines multiple client Excel files into a single, standardized format ready for ingestion.

# Purpose
Automates manual consolidation of incoming client files, removing the manual steps by:
1. Iterating through all the files in a specified directory.
2. Identifying, extracting and combining relevant data.
3. Outputting a consolidated dataset in a defined, ingestion-ready layout.

# Usage
Open the VBA editor in Excel. Add and run the [script](https://github.com/Leighton01/combine-files/blob/main/Excel_File_Combiner.bas) and enter the folder path containing the raw files.
